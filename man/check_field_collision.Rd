\usage{
check_field_collision(fname = "phe", data_names = NULL,
  function_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fname}{(character) name of function to present in warning message}

\item{data_names}{(character vector) vector of dataset names}

\item{function_names}{(character vector) vector of fields overwritten by
function}
}
\value{
(bool) true if no overlap.  False if any overlap.
}
\description{
Collisions may occur with arguments and fixed function internal names.
Report on these as warnings.
}
\details{
Two sets of names are of interest:

\itemize{
  \item names of fields already in the data frame (data_names)
  \item names of fields that will be mutated by the function (function_names)
}

 Warnings are issued for this case:

\itemize{
  \item function_names overlap with data_names
}
}
